# Rick and Morty App 🧪💥

https://rick-morty-app-ashy.vercel.app/

This is a web application based on the popular TV show ["The Rick and Morty API"](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) which uses the official Rick and Morty API to provide users access to a vast amount of information about the show's characters, images, locations, and episodes. The main goal of this project is to showcase my programming skills and what I've learned in the web development field.

## Features
The app offers a library of cards displaying the different characters and their main features from the show "Rick and Morty". Users can interact with the page in various ways, including searching for a specific character using the search bar, clicking on a card to view its details, filtering characters by status, gender, and species, using the navigation bar to sort the cards by characters, episodes, and locations, or simply browsing through all the characters using the pagination bar at the bottom of the page.

## Technologies Used
This app was built using:

* React
* React Hooks [useState, useEffect]
* Fetch API
* Bootstrap and SASS for the page design
* React Paginate library to create the pagination bar
* React Router to configure routes and enable dynamic navigation
* Installation and Usage
